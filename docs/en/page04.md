# Compile AVM - High-Level Language - Variables

We've already discussed address translation, so this article is only about how to convert high-level languages into AVM.

## How to compile variables

The first problem are the variables. In the high-level language, we are accustomed to variables. In the NEOVM instruction sequence, there is obviously no variable.

```
int a=0;
```

So such a high-level language instruction, obviously cannot be converted.

```
   int a=1;
   int b=2;
   return a + b;
```

We need to think about what we have in NEOVM, we have a CalcStack and a AltStack.
The CalcStack is easy to use to calculate a simple evaluation expression, such as "1+2+3+4", but once the variable appears, it seems more complicated.


Constant computation is very easy to express with the CalcStack:
```
    const int a=0;
    const int b=2;
    return a+b;

    ==>

    PUSH 0
    PUSH 2
    ADD
    RET
```
The trouble with variables is that they can change, so they should come from a location, not a specific value.

For example, a variable table, let's take a look at this program with the idea of a variable table.

Suppose we have a global variable table
```
    //we have a List<int> values;
    int a=1; //a is values[0]
    //values[0] = 1;
    int b=2; //b is values[1]
    //values[1] = 2;
    return a + b;
    //return values[0]+values[1]
```

In fact, to compile this code, we need to create a variable table.
Let's first design two pseudocodes to operate our variable table.

STLOC  Put the values into the variable table.

LDLOC  Take the values from the variable table.

Using pseudocode to represent this program is:
```
    //int a=1
    PUSH 1
    STLOC 0
    //int b=2
    PUSH 2
    STLOC 1
    //return a+b
    LDLOC 0
    LDLOC 1
    ADD

    RET
```

Then we write the variable table directly in the form of codeï¼š

NEWARRAY  
PICKITEM  
SETITEM  

These operations are available to NEOVM. We create a variable table on the AltStack when the function is started, and remove the variable table when the instruction is RET.

```
    //CreateArray size=2
    PUSH 2
    NEWARRAY
    TOALTSTACK

    //int a=1
    DUPFROMALTSTACK //getarray
    PUSH 0//index
    PUSH 1//value
    SETITEM

    //int b=2
    DUPFROMALTSTACK //getarray
    PUSH 1//index
    PUSH 2//value
    SETITEM

    //get value a
    DUPFROMALTSTACK //getarray
    PUSH 0//index
    PICKITEM

    //get value b
    DUPFROMALTSTACK //getarray
    PUSH 1//index
    PICKITEM

    //add
    ADD

    //return
    //cleararray
    FROMALTSTACK
    DROP
    RET
```

The code is divided into distinct parts.

Step01 is to interpret the C# source code as an abstract syntax tree (AST). Here we can call rosyln directly to solve this problem. Whatever high-level language you are going to compile, there are a lot of tools that you can use to interpret it as an AST.

Step02 is the part that compiles the AST into assembly. This part is the main job of the compiler.

Step03 is the job of the linker, and it's always the same regardless of what you compile and from.
In the next article we will discuss the code that does the same thing from IL to AVM, where you will find that step03 is still the same code.

Then you test with NEOVM, and no doubt you'll get result 3.

```
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int a=1;
        int b=2;
        return a+b;
    }
}
//result 3
```

This is the output:
